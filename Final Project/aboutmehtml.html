              Anusha Palanivelu, a 16 year old living in San Ramon, has a talent in voicing<br>
              her unique and thoughful opinions, motivated   by her remarkable interest to  <br>
              interact with her peers. She contributed greatly to this project through her <br>
              in-depth research on the presidential candidates, following with presenting the <br>
              various views on policies and helping write the game script. Anusha was introduced<br>
              to the world of code from the event Hackathon, eager to manipulate something<br>
              to turn it into something new. She joined Girls Who Code and is really grateful<br>
              for the experience she recieve on the exposure for coding.<br>

                Gwendolyn Patwardhan, a 16 year old living in San Jose, greatly contributed to this project by<br>
                designing and illustrating the characters for our game. Additionally, she extensively worked on  <br>
                the research of the presidential candidates, the policies and scriptwriting. Her contribution to this<br>
                project has greatly impacted the condition of this project. Gwen’s first experience with coding<br>
                was in 4th grade when she found a course on Khan Academy and decided she wanted to try it<br>
                out. At first, when she started she really enjoyed it but after a while, she got bored and stopped.<br>
                But then after her sister participated in Girls Who Code, she decided she wanted to do the same<br>
                and try it out. Her advice for everyone is to try everything because especially for coding you can<br>
                combine it with almost anything. This experience has taught Gwen amazing sisterhood and a lot<br>
                more about coding.<br>

                  Hannah Zhuang, an upcoming junior in highschool living in Richmond, her curiosity for the<br>
                  fascinating world of technology led her to explore this complex network in hopes of contributing<br>
                  her own unique ideas. She loves to bring her bubbly personality into the conversation,<br>
                  spreading enthusiasm among her peers, and challenging herself to develop various skills to<br>
                  improve her work ethic. Hannah contributed to the project by partaking in the web development<br>
                  team, helping code and design the pages for the project website. She was introduced to the<br>
                  GWC program through school, finding that this was the perfect opportunity to discover the<br>
                  various career paths to pursue.This program has left Hannah was an amazing sisterhood and<br>

                  the script really ensured the team worked as efficiently as possible. Her first encounter with<br>
                  coding was in 7th grade, the experience left a sour impression on her. However, when she<br>
                  learned of Girls Who Code years later, she decided to give it another shot. Though she endured<br>
                  her fair share of trials and tribulations throughout the program, she developed strong bonds with<br>
                  her peers and her love for coding grew. She considers herself lucky for being able to experience<br>
                  a program that nurtured such a healthy environment to learn more about the field of computer<br>
                  science and her own capabilities.

                  the construction of the game and the basic structuring of the website. She has always <br>
                  possessed an intrest in the field of computer science and her skills for communication helped to<br>
                  organize the infrastructure of the project. Her first experience with coding was in school with <br>
                  programs such as Code.org and Scratch, where she further explored her love for video games<br>
                  and how they were made. She first learned of Girls Who code through her teacher and a friend’s<br>
                  sister. She’s thankful for the program exposing her to the experiences of working a 9 to 5 and<br>
                  the ideal workplace full of a diversity of backgrounds and ideas.
